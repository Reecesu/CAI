# schema-interface

## Introduction

This is a web tool to visualize KAIROS Schema Format generated schemas using Cytoscape.js and React.js. The tool also allows editing of these schemas for curation purpose. Current supported SDF version is **1.3**.

**This project is currently a work in progress and is in alpha testing. Feedbacks and suggestions are welcome.**

## Getting Started

To run the project locally one needs to have following libraries installed:

* npm 6.13.4 (or latest)
* Python 3.7.3 (or latest)
* pip 20.1.1 (or latest)

First run:

* cd path/to/project/schema-interface
* sh first_run.sh
* _If rendering fails_: sh run_local.sh 

Subsequent runs:

* cd path/to/project/schema-interface
* sh run_local.sh

Once the server has started, run the localhost with the port mentioned in the terminal in the browser. The tool will render.

## Libraries

The tool mainly uses 3 resources:

* [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) : A Python micro web framework used for writing the backend functionality of the tool. Schema extraction and edit handling has been done in Flask.
* [React.js](https://reactjs.org/): A frontend JavaScript library responible for rendering the UI. All the interactions between the visualization and the backend framwork is handled by React.
* [Cytoscape.js](https://js.cytoscape.org/): A data visualization library that uses the extracted schema, provided by React from backend, to provide a graphical structure in a sequential order. CRUD operations on the visualizations is currently being handled by using _**[react-json-view](https://github.com/mac-s-g/react-json-view/blob/master/README.md)**_ library. This library allows updation of the schemas and Cytoscape reloads the graph with added change.

## Usage

Currently only the **Viewer** is available for use. **Home** is a landing page and **GitHub** links to this repository.

### Viewer
- **Upload Schema** to upload a JSON file from your local file system, and **download** it when you are done with curation.
- **Canvas** shows a graphical representation of the uploaded JSON file. The canvas allows for zoom and node drag-and-drop. **Reloading** the canvas is supported with a reload icon on the top right corner of the canvas. Nodes can be clicked to show subtrees of children nodes and participants.
- **JSON Editor**[[1]](https://github.com/josdejong/jsoneditor/tree/master) showing the uploaded JSON. Editing the JSON will update the graph in the canvas. Functionalities include:
  - **âš  A bug crashes the website when a field with an empty value is instantiated, so *please duplicate existing fields* instead of adding, for example, empty strings when adding new information.**
  - **Expand and Collapse All** lists and dictionaries of the JSON.
  - **Sort contents**
  - **History** for accidents.
  - **Search Bar** to locate events more easily.
  - **Drag** to move fields and their values between lists and dictionaries.
  - **Templates** of events, children, participants, etc. for easier curation.
  - **Duplication**
  - **Deletion**
- A **Sidebar** is available on the left side of the canvas giving information about the selected node. This window opens only when a node is right-clicked. It gives the details about the node, such as its name, id, description, comments, explanation from TA1, importance, etc. All information is directly taken from the JSON.
