            "T: We got the compound part down,",
            "T: that was the challenging part.",
            "T: Single compound \u2013",
            "T: because there were still two pulleys in there, right?",
            "T: But now it\u2019s a single compound.",
            "T: Say it again?",
            "T: No, it wasn\u2019t that.",
            "T: Because if we look at our data,",
            "T: that one had more than one strand in it.",
            "T: It\u2019s not that.",
            "T: So, we saw another \u2013",
            "T: the moveable pulley also had two supporting strands though.",
            "T: So it can\u2019t be that that made it a single compound.",
            "T: Okay?",
            "T: That\u2019s compound.",
            "T: So what\u2019s the single part mean?",
            "T: One of what?",
            "T: I feel like you\u2019re onto it.",
            "T: It just didn\u2019t come out right.",
            "T: What do you mean by that?",
            "T: Because there\u2019s two pulleys there.",
            "T: I \u2013",
            "T: I feel like you get it",
            "T: but I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s coming out right.",
            "T: What do you mean by that?",
            "T: Okay, go ahead.",
            "T: Okay,",
            "T: but what if I said this.",
            "T: Today you\u2019re going to build a double compound pulley.",
            "T: So...",
            "T: So now we have to know",
            "T: (inaudible).",
            "T: That is the most common guess actually.",
            "T: For a double compound pulley, the most common guess is that we\u2019re going to have two fixed and two moveable.",
            "T: We are not.",
            "T: The double compound pulley only has two pulleys.",
            "T: One of them is?",
            "T: And one of them is?",
            "T: Because that\u2019s what we defined as compound.",
            "T: Compound means one fixed and one moveable.",
            "T: But yeah, we can build single compounds and double compounds.",
            "T: So what do you think..?",
            "T: Nope.",
            "T: Still only one fixed and one moveable.",
            "T: Look at the picture on page 17.",
            "T: You should have made some predictions on page 17.",
            "T: So if you look at the picture,",
            "T: that is a picture of a double compound pulley system.",
            "T: Double compound pulley system.",
            "T: Now think about what that single compound pulley system looked like",
            "T: when you did the lab.",
            "T: See if you can figure out \u2013",
            "T: they\u2019re both compounds",
            "T: because they both have what?",
            "T: A fixed and moveable.",
            "T: But, one\u2019s a single compound and one\u2019s a double compound.",
            "T: Think you got it?",
            "T: So we see that it has more strands, right?",
            "T: We can see from the picture that it looks like more strands there.",
            "T: Why are there more strands there?",
            "T: Two of what?",
            "T: Oh.",
            "T: So look at the double compound pulley.",
            "T: Each pulley has how many wheels on it?",
            "T: Two wheels.",
            "T: So what does that mean",
            "T: a single compound pulley is?",
            "T: It\u2019s a one wheel pulley.",
            "T: You have one wheel one it.",
            "T: What if you built a quadruple compound pulley system",
            "T: and put all that together.",
            "T: What would that be?",
            "T: There\u2019d be 4 wheels on a (inaudible) pulley,",
            "T: and it\u2019s a quadruple compound,",
            "T: so what does that mean?",
            "T: Each pulley has 4 wheels...",
            "T: And there\u2019s one fixed, and one moveable",
            "T: and each one has 4 wheels.",
            "T: Alright.",
            "T: So now we\u2019re starting to picture what those systems might look like,",
            "T: I hope.",
            "T: What if you set up a triple double compound pulley system?",
            "T: A triple double compound pulley system.",
            "T: What do you think that is?",
            "T: So you\u2019ve got a pulley \u2013 fixed and a moveable.",
            "T: One of them has 2 wheels,",
            "T: one of them has 3 wheels.",
            "T: Alright, now I think",
            "T: we\u2019re getting it.",
            "T: So, on page 17, you were asked to make some predictions about building your double compound pulley system,",
            "T: right, one that you have not tested yet.",
            "T: You\u2019ve tested single fixed, single \u2013 um, double fixed, moveable, and single compound.",
            "T: So it asks 3 questions on predicting for this double compound pulley system.",
            "T: I\u2019m going to have you share your predictions with your group,",
            "T: but whenever you share multiple choice question,",
            "T: most important part of sharing is what?",
            "T: Why.",
            "T: Right?",
            "T: It\u2019s not what you chose out of 4 multiple choice options,",
            "T: it\u2019s why did you choose that.",
            "T: Why does that option make the most sense.",
            "T: Um, at this point, we\u2019re almost done with this pulley packet, right?",
            "T: We\u2019ve got the lab today,",
            "T: you\u2019ve got your final,",
            "T: um, thinking about your final challenge on Tuesday,",
            "T: there\u2019s no school Monday for you,",
            "T: so Tuesday",
            "T: thinking about your final challenge",
            "T: and then Wednesday\u2019s the assessment.",
            "T: So you are almost done with this packet.",
            "T: So I\u2019m expecting your explanations of why you chose that to be pretty good at this point.",
            "T: Because you\u2019ve done almost everything in this packet.",
            "T: So there shouldn\u2019t be any just random guesses on here,",
            "T: your conversations",
            "T: of why you picked it",
            "T: should be pretty darn good at this point,",
            "T: using that physics terminology.",
            "T: So that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to be listening for",
            "T: as I walk around,",
            "T: is why did you choose those for those 3 predictions.",
            "T: If you\u2019ve got a recorder",
            "T: why don\u2019t you start it",
            "T: before you share your predictions.",
            "T: Good.",
            "T: That\u2019s a decent number.",
            "T: That\u2019s what I was kind of watching for",
            "T: as I listened to you.",
            "T: Um, looking for some people",
            "T: to do some explaining",
            "T: by flipping back to their data previously",
            "T: and say hey, look at what happened here.",
            "T: This is why I think",
            "T: this is what\u2019s going to happen now.",
            "T: So that\u2019s a decent number of you",
            "T: that used data,",
            "T: hopefully that helped you to make some predictions.",
            "T: Um, if you flip to page (7).",
            "T: Um, on page 18, are the directions for your lab,",
            "T: but just like last time, you can see",
            "T: it\u2019s not really step by step,",
            "T: it\u2019s a little more open ended.",
            "T: You\u2019re going to be using all available materials",
            "T: to set up your double compound system",
            "T: and gather your data,",
            "T: right?",
            "T: And it says a few more words on page 18,",
            "T: but still not step by step.",
            "T: If you look at page 19,",
            "T: there\u2019s your data table.",
            "T: It looks exactly like your data table from before,",
            "T: except now it\u2019s the double compound pulley system.",
            "T: But you\u2019re still collecting the same data.",
            "T: At the very top, what\u2019s the very first piece of data",
            "T: you should write down?",
            "T: The load.",
            "T: Which is AKA...?",
            "T: The weight of the thing, right?",
            "T: The weight of the statue.",
            "T: Um, measured in Newtons.",
            "T: So, you\u2019ll write down the weight of your statue",
            "T: and similar to before, the distance that your statue moves has to be what?",
            "T: .1 meters, AKA 10 centimeters.",
            "T: So still moving the object to the same height.",
            "T: Our pulley system for each, um, all the data we\u2019re collecting for our pulley system changes the direction of force,",
            "T: remember that means...?",
            "T: So you pull...?",
            "T: Down, object goes up,",
            "T: (would) it be changing it.",
            "T: Your applied force, that you \u2013 have to \u2013 force",
            "T: you apply",
            "T: to get that object to move.",
            "T: The distance you pull,",
            "T: so remember",
            "T: like last time you have to measure where your hands starts and where your hand ends",
            "T: to know how far you had to pull",
            "T: in order to get the object to move-",
            "T: Yeah, so both of them.",
            "T: Number of strands, number of supporting strands.",
            "T: So when you have it set up,",
            "T: take a look at it,",
            "T: count up how many supporting strands there are.",
            "T: And then, ideal MA, how do you figure that out again?",
            "T: How did you know that?",
            "T: Oh, it says it right there,",
            "T: again, right, weren\u2019t you the one to figure it out last time in this class too?",
            "T: Yeah.",
            "T: So you\u2019re taking your two distances,",
            "T: dividing them by each other.",
            "T: You may have found on (VidyaMap) this morning,",
            "T: someone said,",
            "T: well it\u2019s the input distance",
            "T: divided by the output distance.",
            "T: Are they right?",
            "T: Which would be for the pulley?",
            "T: Well,",
            "T: if you\u2019re talking about input,",
            "T: it\u2019s what?",
            "T: Distance you pull.",
            "T: And then the other one would be?",
            "T: Distance the thing is lifted.",
            "T: Um, you\u2019ve got your force sensor, however \u2013",
            "T: and that\u2019s why you have a Chromebook too,",
            "T: so you can do that in your app again.",
            "T: This morning Google had a major malfunction",
            "T: and that app was not loading for anybody.",
            "T: So there was like,",
            "T: I don\u2019t know,",
            "T: 20 different tech people in the district on it",
            "T: until they found out",
            "T: it was a Google issue",
            "T: and now Google\u2019s on it apparently.",
            "T: I haven\u2019t checked,",
            "T: it might be working.",
            "T: So",
            "T: if you",
            "T: (Near App)",
            "T: is working,",
            "T: load that",
            "T: and use it",
            "T: just like you did in the other lab.",
            "T: As a backup,",
            "T: if you get to the point",

            "T: I put a spring scale in all of your boxes",
            "T: that doesn\u2019t need the technology",
            "T: that that does.",
            "T: Um, use the force sensor",
            "T: if at all possible,",

            "T: if it\u2019s not loading,",

            "T: and",
            "T: if it doesn\u2019t,",

            "T: you\u2019re pulling straight,",
            "T: right,",
            "T: so don\u2019t try to pull the string at an angle like that",
            "T: to measure it,",
            "T: pull straight down",
            "T: or",

            "T: That\u2019s how you use these.",

            "T: it should be the same.",

            "T: you want to keep the slack out of the string as much as possible, right?",

            "T: they\u2019re both compounds",

            "T: A fixed and moveable.",

            "T: Think you got it?",
            "T: So we see that it has more strands, right?",

            "T: Why are there more strands there?",
            "T: Two of what?",
            "T: Oh.",
            "T: So look at the double compound pulley.",
            "T: Each pulley has how many wheels on it?",
            "T: Two wheels.",
            "T: So what does that mean",
            "T: a single compound pulley is?",
            "T: It\u2019s a one wheel pulley.",
            "T: You have one wheel one it.",
            "T: What if you built a quadruple compound pulley system",
            "T: and put all that together.",
            "T: What would that be?",
            "T: There\u2019d be 4 wheels on a (inaudible) pulley,",
            "T: and it\u2019s a quadruple compound,",
            "T: so what does that mean?",
            "T: Each pulley has 4 wheels...",
            "T: And there\u2019s one fixed, and one moveable",
            "T: and each one has 4 wheels.",
            "T: Alright.",
            "T: So now we\u2019re starting to picture what those systems might look like,",
            "T: I hope.",
            "T: What if you set up a triple double compound pulley system?",
            "T: A triple double compound pulley system.",
            "T: What do you think that is?",
            "T: So you\u2019ve got a pulley \u2013 fixed and a moveable.",
            "T: One of them has 2 wheels,",
            "T: one of them has 3 wheels.",
            "T: Alright, now I think",
            "T: we\u2019re getting it.",
            "T: So, on page 17, you were asked to make some predictions about building your double compound pulley system,",
            "T: right, one that you have not tested yet.",
            "T: You\u2019ve tested single fixed, single \u2013 um, double fixed, moveable, and single compound.",
            "T: So it asks 3 questions on predicting for this double compound pulley system.",
            "T: I\u2019m going to have you share your predictions with your group,",
            "T: but whenever you share multiple choice question,",
            "T: most important part of sharing is what?",
            "T: Why.",
            "T: Right?",
            "T: It\u2019s not what you chose out of 4 multiple choice options,",
            "T: it\u2019s why did you choose that.",
            "T: Why does that option make the most sense.",
            "T: Um, at this point, we\u2019re almost done with this pulley packet, right?",
            "T: We\u2019ve got the lab today,",
            "T: you\u2019ve got your final,",
            "T: um, thinking about your final challenge on Tuesday,",
            "T: there\u2019s no school Monday for you,",
            "T: so Tuesday",
            "T: thinking about your final challenge",
            "T: and then Wednesday\u2019s the assessment.",
            "T: So you are almost done with this packet.",
            "T: So I\u2019m expecting your explanations of why you chose that to be pretty good at this point.",
            "T: Because you\u2019ve done almost everything in this packet.",
            "T: So there shouldn\u2019t be any just random guesses on here,",
            "T: your conversations",
            "T: of why you picked it",
            "T: should be pretty darn good at this point,",
            "T: using that physics terminology.",
            "T: So that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to be listening for",
            "T: as I walk around,",
            "T: is why did you choose those for those 3 predictions.",
            "T: If you\u2019ve got a recorder",
            "T: why don\u2019t you start it",
            "T: before you share your predictions.",
            "T: Good.",
            "T: That\u2019s a decent number.",
            "T: That\u2019s what I was kind of watching for",
            "T: as I listened to you.",
            "T: Um, looking for some people",
            "T: to do some explaining",
            "T: by flipping back to their data previously",
            "T: and say hey, look at what happened here.",
            "T: This is why I think",
            "T: this is what\u2019s going to happen now.",
            "T: So that\u2019s a decent number of you",
            "T: that used data,",
            "T: hopefully that helped you to make some predictions.",
            "T: Um, if you flip to page (7).",
            "T: Um, on page 18, are the directions for your lab,",
            "T: but just like last time, you can see",
            "T: it\u2019s not really step by step,",
            "T: it\u2019s a little more open ended.",
            "T: You\u2019re going to be using all available materials",
            "T: to set up your double compound system",
            "T: and gather your data,",
            "T: right?",
            "T: And it says a few more words on page 18,",
            "T: but still not step by step.",
            "T: If you look at page 19,",
            "T: there\u2019s your data table.",
            "T: It looks exactly like your data table from before,",
            "T: except now it\u2019s the double compound pulley system.",
            "T: But you\u2019re still collecting the same data.",
            "T: At the very top, what\u2019s the very first piece of data",
            "T: you should write down?",
            "T: The load.",
            "T: Which is AKA...?",
            "T: The weight of the thing, right?",
            "T: The weight of the statue.",
            "T: Um, measured in Newtons.",
            "T: So, you\u2019ll write down the weight of your statue",
            "T: and similar to before, the distance that your statue moves has to be what?",
            "T: .1 meters, AKA 10 centimeters.",
            "T: So still moving the object to the same height.",
            "T: Our pulley system for each, um, all the data we\u2019re collecting for our pulley system changes the direction of force,",
            "T: remember that means...?",
            "T: So you pull...?",
            "T: Down, object goes up,",
            "T: (would) it be changing it.",
            "T: Your applied force, that you \u2013 have to \u2013 force",

            "T: to get that object to move.",
            "T: The distance you pull,",
            "T: so remember",
            "T: like last time you have to measure where your hands starts and where your hand ends",

            "T: in order to get the object to move-",
            "T: Yeah, so both of them.",
            "T: Number of strands, number of supporting strands.",
            "T: So when you have it set up,",

            "T: Yeah.",

            "T: You may have found on (VidyaMap) this morning,",

            "T: we\u2019re getting it.",
            "T: So, on page 17, you were asked to make some predictions about building your double compound pulley system,",
            "T: right, one that you have not tested yet.",
            "T: You\u2019ve tested single fixed, single \u2013 um, double fixed, moveable, and single compound.",

            "T: I\u2019m going to have you share your predictions with your group,",
            "T: but whenever you share multiple choice question,",

            "T: and then Wednesday\u2019s the assessment.",
            "T: So you are almost done with this packet.",
            "T: So I\u2019m expecting your explanations of why you chose that to be pretty good at this point.",

            "T: And then you tested out a double fixed.",
            "T: Which means, what?",
            "T: Two pulleys that are both...?",
            "T: Fixed in one position,",
            "T: and you have the rope over it.",
            "T: Then you tested out a moveable.",
            "T: Can anyone tell me what a moveable pulley means?",
            "T: Yeah,",
            "T: so it moves with you",
            "T: as you are pulling.",
            "T: Moves with that load",
            "T: as you are pulling.",
            "T: So you tested out a moveable,",
            "T: then you tested out a single compound.",
            "T: So what do you think",
            "T: the compound part of that term means?",
            "T: Let\u2019s see",
            "T: if you can get anybody else.",
            "T: We\u2019ve got two",
            "T: that",
            "T: I feel like",
            "T: are understanding it.",
            "T: What do you think",
            "T: compound means in there?",
            "T: What do you think?",
            "T: I\u2019m trying to get what you\u2019re...",
            "T: A string?",
            "T: Um, we did look that it had more supporting strands than the fixed one,",
            "T: we saw that.",
            "T: Um, but that\u2019s not what compound means.",
            "T: Think about what the compound pulley system looked like.",
            "T: There\u2019s one fixed in there",
            "T: and there\u2019s one moveable in there.",
            "T: So that\u2019s the compound.",
            "T: What does it mean to have a single compound?",
            "T: We need to have a single compound.",
            "T: I almost feel like I\u2019m having a discussion with (inaudible) here.",
            "T: Anybody else?",
            "T: We got the compound part down,",
            "T: that was the challenging part.",
            "T: Single compound \u2013",
            "T: because there were still two pulleys in there, right?",
            "T: But now it\u2019s a single compound.",
            "T: Say it again?",
            "T: No, it wasn\u2019t that.",
            "T: Because if we look at our data,",
            "T: that one had more than one strand in it.",
            "T: It\u2019s not that.",
            "T: So, we saw another \u2013",
            "T: the moveable pulley also had two supporting strands though.",
            "T: So it can\u2019t be that that made it a single compound.",
            "T: Okay?",
            "T: That\u2019s compound.",
            "T: So what\u2019s the single part mean?",
            "T: One of what?",
            "T: I feel like you\u2019re onto it.",
            "T: It just didn\u2019t come out right.",
            "T: What do you mean by that?",
            "T: Because there\u2019s two pulleys there.",
            "T: I \u2013",
            "T: I feel like you get it",
            "T: but I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s coming out right.",
            "T: What do you mean by that?",
            "T: Okay, go ahead.",
            "T: Okay,",
            "T: but what if I said this.",
            "T: Today you\u2019re going to build a double compound pulley.",
            "T: So...",
            "T: So now we have to know",
            "T: (inaudible).",
            "T: That is the most common guess actually.",
            "T: For a double compound pulley, the most common guess is that we\u2019re going to have two fixed and two moveable.",
            "T: We are not.",
            "T: The double compound pulley only has two pulleys.",
            "T: One of them is?",
            "T: And one of them is?",
            "T: Because that\u2019s what we defined as compound.",
            "T: Compound means one fixed and one moveable.",
            "T: But yeah, we can build single compounds and double compounds.",
            "T: So what do you think..?",
            "T: Nope.",
            "T: Still only one fixed and one moveable.",
            "T: Look at the picture on page 17.",
            "T: You should have made some predictions on page 17.",
            "T: So if you look at the picture,",
            "T: that is a picture of a double compound pulley system.",
            "T: Double compound pulley system.",
            "T: Now think about what that single compound pulley system looked like",
            "T: when you did the lab.",
            "T: See if you can figure out \u2013",
            "T: they\u2019re both compounds",
            "T: because they both have what?",
            "T: A fixed and moveable.",
            "T: But, one\u2019s a single compound and one\u2019s a double compound.",
            "T: Think you got it?",
            "T: So we see that it has more strands, right?",
            "T: We can see from the picture that it looks like more strands there.",
            "T: Why are there more strands there?",
            "T: Two of what?",
            "T: Oh.",
            "T: So look at the double compound pulley.",
            "T: Each pulley has how many wheels on it?",
            "T: Two wheels.",
            "T: So what does that mean",
            "T: a single compound pulley is?",
            "T: It\u2019s a one wheel pulley.",
            "T: You have one wheel one it.",
            "T: What if you built a quadruple compound pulley system",
            "T: and put all that together.",
            "T: What would that be?",
            "T: There\u2019d be 4 wheels on a (inaudible) pulley,",
            "T: and it\u2019s a quadruple compound,",
            "T: so what does that mean?",
            "T: Each pulley has 4 wheels...",
            "T: And there\u2019s one fixed, and one moveable",
            "T: and each one has 4 wheels.",
            "T: Alright.",
            "T: So now we\u2019re starting to picture what those systems might look like,",
            "T: I hope.",
            "T: What if you set up a triple double compound pulley system?",
            "T: A triple double compound pulley system.",
            "T: What do you think that is?",
            "T: So you\u2019ve got a pulley \u2013 fixed and a moveable.",
            "T: One of them has 2 wheels,",
            "T: one of them has 3 wheels.",
            "T: Alright, now I think",
            "T: we\u2019re getting it.",
            "T: So, on page 17, you were asked to make some predictions about building your double compound pulley system,",
            "T: right, one that you have not tested yet.",
            "T: You\u2019ve tested single fixed, single \u2013 um, double fixed, moveable, and single compound.",
            "T: So it asks 3 questions on predicting for this double compound pulley system.",
            "T: I\u2019m going to have you share your predictions with your group,",
            "T: but whenever you share multiple choice question,",
            "T: most important part of sharing is what?",
            "T: Why.",
            "T: Right?",
            "T: It\u2019s not what you chose out of 4 multiple choice options,",
            "T: it\u2019s why did you choose that.",
            "T: Why does that option make the most sense.",
            "T: Um, at this point, we\u2019re almost done with this pulley packet, right?",
            "T: We\u2019ve got the lab today,",
            "T: you\u2019ve got your final,",
            "T: um, thinking about your final challenge on Tuesday,",
            "T: there\u2019s no school Monday for you,",
            "T: so Tuesday",
            "T: thinking about your final challenge",
            "T: and then Wednesday\u2019s the assessment.",
            "T: So you are almost done with this packet.",
            "T: So I\u2019m expecting your explanations of why you chose that to be pretty good at this point.",
            "T: Because you\u2019ve done almost everything in this packet.",
            "T: So there shouldn\u2019t be any just random guesses on here,",
            "T: your conversations",
            "T: of why you picked it",
            "T: should be pretty darn good at this point,",
            "T: using that physics terminology.",
            "T: So that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to be listening for",
            "T: as I walk around,",
            "T: is why did you choose those for those 3 predictions.",
            "T: If you\u2019ve got a recorder",
            "T: why don\u2019t you start it",
            "T: before you share your predictions.",
            "T: Good.",
            "T: That\u2019s a decent number.",
            "T: That\u2019s what I was kind of watching for",
            "T: as I listened to you.",
            "T: Um, looking for some people",
            "T: to do some explaining",
            "T: by flipping back to their data previously",
            "T: and say hey, look at what happened here.",
            "T: This is why I think",
            "T: this is what\u2019s going to happen now.",
            "T: So that\u2019s a decent number of you",
            "T: that used data,",
            "T: hopefully that helped you to make some predictions.",
            "T: Um, if you flip to page (7).",
            "T: Um, on page 18, are the directions for your lab,",
            "T: but just like last time, you can see",
            "T: it\u2019s not really step by step,",
            "T: it\u2019s a little more open ended.",
            "T: You\u2019re going to be using all available materials",
            "T: to set up your double compound system",
            "T: and gather your data,",
            "T: right?",
            "T: And it says a few more words on page 18,",
            "T: but still not step by step.",
            "T: If you look at page 19,",
            "T: there\u2019s your data table.",
            "T: It looks exactly like your data table from before,",
            "T: except now it\u2019s the double compound pulley system.",
            "T: But you\u2019re still collecting the same data.",
            "T: At the very top, what\u2019s the very first piece of data",
            "T: you should write down?",
            "T: The load.",
            "T: Which is AKA...?",
            "T: The weight of the thing, right?",
            "T: The weight of the statue.",
            "T: Um, measured in Newtons.",
            "T: So, you\u2019ll write down the weight of your statue",
            "T: and similar to before, the distance that your statue moves has to be what?",
            "T: .1 meters, AKA 10 centimeters.",
            "T: So still moving the object to the same height.",
            "T: Our pulley system for each, um, all the data we\u2019re collecting for our pulley system changes the direction of force,",
            "T: remember that means...?",
            "T: So you pull...?",
            "T: Down, object goes up,",
            "T: (would) it be changing it.",
            "T: Your applied force, that you \u2013 have to \u2013 force",
            "T: you apply",
            "T: to get that object to move.",
            "T: The distance you pull,",
            "T: so remember",
            "T: like last time you have to measure where your hands starts and where your hand ends",
            "T: to know how far you had to pull",
            "T: in order to get the object to move-",
            "T: Yeah, so both of them.",
            "T: Number of strands, number of supporting strands.",
            "T: So when you have it set up,",
            "T: take a look at it,",
            "T: count up how many supporting strands there are.",
            "T: And then, ideal MA, how do you figure that out again?",
            "T: How did you know that?",
            "T: Oh, it says it right there,",
            "T: again, right, weren\u2019t you the one to figure it out last time in this class too?",
            "T: Yeah.",
            "T: So you\u2019re taking your two distances,",
            "T: dividing them by each other.",
            "T: You may have found on (VidyaMap) this morning,",
            "T: someone said,",

            "T: divided by the output distance.",
            "T: Are they right?",

            "T: Well,",
            "T: if you\u2019re talking about input,",
            "T: it\u2019s what?",
            "T: Distance you pull.",
            "T: And then the other one would be?",
            "T: Distance the thing is lifted.",
            "T: Um, you\u2019ve got your force sensor, however \u2013",
            "T: and that\u2019s why you have a Chromebook too,",
            "T: so you can do that in your app again.",
            "T: This morning Google had a major malfunction",

            "T: until they found out",

            "T: I haven\u2019t checked,",
            "T: it might be working.",

            "T: (Near App)",
            "T: is working,",
            "T: load that",

            "T: You have one wheel one it.",

            "T: What would that be?",
            "T: There\u2019d be 4 wheels on a (inaudible) pulley,",

            "T: so what does that mean?",
            "T: Each pulley has 4 wheels...",
            "T: And there\u2019s one fixed, and one moveable",
            "T: and each one has 4 wheels.",
            "T: Alright.",
            "T: So now we\u2019re starting to picture what those systems might look like,",
            "T: I hope.",
            "T: What if you set up a triple double compound pulley system?",
            "T: A triple double compound pulley system.",
            "T: What do you think that is?",
            "T: So you\u2019ve got a pulley \u2013 fixed and a moveable.",
            "T: One of them has 2 wheels,",
            "T: one of them has 3 wheels.",
            "T: Alright, now I think",
            "T: we\u2019re getting it.",
            "T: So, on page 17, you were asked to make some predictions about building your double compound pulley system,",
            "T: right, one that you have not tested yet.",
            "T: You\u2019ve tested single fixed, single \u2013 um, double fixed, moveable, and single compound.",
            "T: So it asks 3 questions on predicting for this double compound pulley system.",
            "T: I\u2019m going to have you share your predictions with your group,",
            "T: but whenever you share multiple choice question,",
            "T: most important part of sharing is what?",
            "T: Why.",
            "T: Right?",
            "T: It\u2019s not what you chose out of 4 multiple choice options,",
            "T: it\u2019s why did you choose that.",
            "T: Why does that option make the most sense.",
            "T: Um, at this point, we\u2019re almost done with this pulley packet, right?",
            "T: We\u2019ve got the lab today,",
            "T: you\u2019ve got your final,",

            "T: and then Wednesday\u2019s the assessment.",
            "T: So you are almost done with this packet.",
            "T: So I\u2019m expecting your explanations of why you chose that to be pretty good at this point.",
            "T: Because you\u2019ve done almost everything in this packet.",
            "T: So there shouldn\u2019t be any just random guesses on here,",
            "T: your conversations",
            "T: of why you picked it",
            "T: should be pretty darn good at this point,",
            "T: using that physics terminology.",
            "T: So that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to be listening for",
            "T: as I walk around,",
            "T: is why did you choose those for those 3 predictions.",
            "T: If you\u2019ve got a recorder",
            "T: why don\u2019t you start it",
            "T: before you share your predictions.",
            "T: Good.",
            "T: That\u2019s a decent number.",
            "T: That\u2019s what I was kind of watching for",
            "T: as I listened to you.",
            "T: Um, looking for some people",
            "T: to do some explaining",
            "T: by flipping back to their data previously",
            "T: and say hey, look at what happened here.",
            "T: This is why I think",
            "T: this is what\u2019s going to happen now.",
            "T: So that\u2019s a decent number of you",
            "T: that used data,",
            "T: hopefully that helped you to make some predictions.",
            "T: Um, if you flip to page (7).",
            "T: Um, on page 18, are the directions for your lab,",
            "T: but just like last time, you can see",

            "T: right?",

            "T: If you look at page 19,",
            "T: there\u2019s your data table.",

            "T: So if you look at the picture,",
            "T: that is a picture of a double compound pulley system.",
            "T: Double compound pulley system.",
            "T: Now think about what that single compound pulley system looked like",
            "T: when you did the lab.",
            "T: See if you can figure out \u2013",
            "T: they\u2019re both compounds",
            "T: because they both have what?",
            "T: A fixed and moveable.",
            "T: But, one\u2019s a single compound and one\u2019s a double compound.",
            "T: Think you got it?",
            "T: So we see that it has more strands, right?",
            "T: We can see from the picture that it looks like more strands there.",
            "T: Why are there more strands there?",
            "T: Two of what?",
            "T: Oh.",
            "T: So look at the double compound pulley.",
            "T: Each pulley has how many wheels on it?",
            "T: Two wheels.",
            "T: So what does that mean",
            "T: a single compound pulley is?",
            "T: It\u2019s a one wheel pulley.",
            "T: You have one wheel one it.",
            "T: What if you built a quadruple compound pulley system",
            "T: and put all that together.",
            "T: What would that be?",
            "T: There\u2019d be 4 wheels on a (inaudible) pulley,",
            "T: and it\u2019s a quadruple compound,",
            "T: so what does that mean?",
            "T: Each pulley has 4 wheels...",
            "T: And there\u2019s one fixed, and one moveable",
            "T: and each one has 4 wheels.",
            "T: Alright.",
            "T: So now we\u2019re starting to picture what those systems might look like,",
            "T: I hope.",
            "T: What if you set up a triple double compound pulley system?",
            "T: A triple double compound pulley system.",
            "T: What do you think that is?",
            "T: So you\u2019ve got a pulley \u2013 fixed and a moveable.",
            "T: One of them has 2 wheels,",
            "T: one of them has 3 wheels.",
            "T: Alright, now I think",
            "T: we\u2019re getting it.",
            "T: So, on page 17, you were asked to make some predictions about building your double compound pulley system,",
            "T: right, one that you have not tested yet.",
            "T: You\u2019ve tested single fixed, single \u2013 um, double fixed, moveable, and single compound.",
            "T: So it asks 3 questions on predicting for this double compound pulley system.",
            "T: I\u2019m going to have you share your predictions with your group,",
            "T: but whenever you share multiple choice question,",
            "T: most important part of sharing is what?",
            "T: Why.",
            "T: Right?",
            "T: It\u2019s not what you chose out of 4 multiple choice options,",
            "T: it\u2019s why did you choose that.",
            "T: Why does that option make the most sense.",
            "T: Um, at this point, we\u2019re almost done with this pulley packet, right?",
            "T: We\u2019ve got the lab today,",
            "T: you\u2019ve got your final,",
            "T: um, thinking about your final challenge on Tuesday,",
            "T: there\u2019s no school Monday for you,",
            "T: so Tuesday",
            "T: thinking about your final challenge",
            "T: and then Wednesday\u2019s the assessment.",
            "T: So you are almost done with this packet.",
            "T: So I\u2019m expecting your explanations of why you chose that to be pretty good at this point.",
            "T: Because you\u2019ve done almost everything in this packet.",
            "T: So there shouldn\u2019t be any just random guesses on here,",
            "T: your conversations",
            "T: of why you picked it",
            "T: should be pretty darn good at this point,",
            "T: using that physics terminology.",
            "T: So that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to be listening for",
            "T: as I walk around,",
            "T: is why did you choose those for those 3 predictions.",
            "T: If you\u2019ve got a recorder",
            "T: why don\u2019t you start it",
            "T: before you share your predictions.",
            "T: Good.",
            "T: That\u2019s a decent number.",
            "T: That\u2019s what I was kind of watching for",
            "T: as I listened to you.",
            "T: Um, looking for some people",
            "T: to do some explaining",
            "T: by flipping back to their data previously",
            "T: and say hey, look at what happened here.",
            "T: This is why I think",
            "T: this is what\u2019s going to happen now.",
            "T: So that\u2019s a decent number of you",
            "T: that used data,",
            "T: hopefully that helped you to make some predictions.",
            "T: Um, if you flip to page (7).",
            "T: Um, on page 18, are the directions for your lab,",
            "T: but just like last time, you can see",
            "T: it\u2019s not really step by step,",
            "T: it\u2019s a little more open ended.",
            "T: You\u2019re going to be using all available materials",
            "T: to set up your double compound system",
            "T: and gather your data,",
            "T: right?",
            "T: And it says a few more words on page 18,",
            "T: but still not step by step.",
            "T: If you look at page 19,",
            "T: there\u2019s your data table.",
            "T: It looks exactly like your data table from before,",
            "T: except now it\u2019s the double compound pulley system.",
            "T: But you\u2019re still collecting the same data.",
            "T: At the very top, what\u2019s the very first piece of data",
            "T: you should write down?",
            "T: The load.",
            "T: Which is AKA...?",
            "T: The weight of the thing, right?",
            "T: The weight of the statue.",
            "T: Um, measured in Newtons.",
            "T: So, you\u2019ll write down the weight of your statue",
            "T: and similar to before, the distance that your statue moves has to be what?",
            "T: .1 meters, AKA 10 centimeters.",
            "T: So still moving the object to the same height.",
            "T: Our pulley system for each, um, all the data we\u2019re collecting for our pulley system changes the direction of force,",
            "T: remember that means...?",
            "T: So you pull...?",
            "T: Down, object goes up,",
            "T: (would) it be changing it.",
            "T: Your applied force, that you \u2013 have to \u2013 force",
            "T: you apply",
            "T: to get that object to move.",
            "T: The distance you pull,",
            "T: so remember",
            "T: like last time you have to measure where your hands starts and where your hand ends",
            "T: to know how far you had to pull",
            "T: in order to get the object to move-",
            "T: Yeah, so both of them.",
            "T: Number of strands, number of supporting strands.",
            "T: So when you have it set up,",
            "T: take a look at it,",
            "T: count up how many supporting strands there are.",
            "T: And then, ideal MA, how do you figure that out again?",
            "T: How did you know that?",
            "T: Oh, it says it right there,",
            "T: again, right, weren\u2019t you the one to figure it out last time in this class too?",
            "T: Yeah.",
            "T: So you\u2019re taking your two distances,",
            "T: dividing them by each other.",
            "T: You may have found on (VidyaMap) this morning,",
            "T: someone said,",
            "T: well it\u2019s the input distance",
            "T: divided by the output distance.",
            "T: Are they right?",
            "T: Which would be for the pulley?",
            "T: Well,",
            "T: if you\u2019re talking about input,",
            "T: it\u2019s what?",
            "T: Distance you pull.",
            "T: And then the other one would be?",
            "T: Distance the thing is lifted.",
            "T: Um, you\u2019ve got your force sensor, however \u2013",
            "T: and that\u2019s why you have a Chromebook too,",
            "T: so you can do that in your app again.",
            "T: This morning Google had a major malfunction",
            "T: and that app was not loading for anybody.",
            "T: So there was like,",

            "T: 20 different tech people in the district on it",
            "T: until they found out",

            "T: I haven\u2019t checked,",
            "T: it might be working.",
            "T: So",

            "T: (Near App)",
            "T: is working,",
            "T: load that",

            "T: that that does.",
            "T: Um, use the force sensor",
            "T: if at all possible,",

            "T: if it\u2019s not loading,",

            "T: just like the hook on your force sensor gets attached to the loop on your string.",
            "T: Um, make sure it says zero",

            "T: and",
            "T: if it doesn\u2019t,",

            "T: That\u2019s how you use these.",
